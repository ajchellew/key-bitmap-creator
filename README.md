# Intro
Helper for creating bitmaps to be used with StreamDeckSharp https://github.com/OpenMacroBoard/StreamDeckSharp

Whilst a great library for interacting with the Stream Deck, as a developer learning how to use SixLabors libraries take a bit of getting used to.

The aim is to make it simple to add elements to a KeyBitmap that are uniform.

For example
- adding background
- adding text of different sizes, correctly aligned.
- adding images from resources/canvas'
- adding polygons (including relatively sized for ease)
